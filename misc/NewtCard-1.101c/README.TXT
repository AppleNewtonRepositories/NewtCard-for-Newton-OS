Adding Additional Sounds and Stamps---------------------------------------You can specifiy sounds to be played when opening or closing cards, backgroundsor the stack, as well as when a button is pressed.A variety of sounds are buit into the eMate and MessagePad.

Moving stacks between systems--------------------------------The PackIt option on the Action Slip can be used to turn the current soup intoa Newton package. The will take a few seconds for a small stack (longer for alarge one), and requires that you have approximately twice the size of theStack left as free space.The package can be moved to a Mac or PC desktop by using XPort.To move a package from one Newton to another, you can beam it, email it, orsend it by any of the other Newton transports.The packages are self extracting stacks. Once on the new Newton, tap on them,and they will turn into NewtCard stacks. When the extraction is complete, youcan delete the package: the information will have been transferred into theStores directory.6.
