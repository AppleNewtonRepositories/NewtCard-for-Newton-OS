NewtCard 1.0 Read Me First                                	December 9, 1997---------------------------------------------------------------------Welcome to Release 1.0 of NewtCard!  NewtCard lets you put text, drawings, pictures and sound into a stack of smart cards. Add buttons to navigate, fields to collect data and scripts to bring your project alive with the tap of a pen.This demonstration version is limited to creating 4 cards and cannot do scripting. If these restrictions hamper your review, please contact us and we will email you the full version.Getting StartedInstall the following packages on your Newton device:NewtCard.pkgNewtDraw.pkg (only if you have a MessagePad. Do not install if you have an eMate!)From the stacks folder:	home-stk.pkg	NewtCard Tour.pkgAfter installing, click on the home-stk.pkg and NewtCard Tour.pkg icons to unpack them. Its OK to delete these packages on the Newton once they are unpacked.Check out the README.TXT file on the diskette for information on all files contained on the diskette.DocumentationThis page gives you just the absolute minimum you need to get started. Continue with the larger NewtCard Handbook for information on using NewtCard. The other book, the NS BASIC Handbook, will be needed once you start doing scripting.Check the README.TXT file on the diskette for information that is too new to be in the Handbook.SupportWe are fully committed to making NewtCard the essential tool for the Newton.
