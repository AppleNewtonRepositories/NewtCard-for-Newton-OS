NewtCard UI Review                					Jun 2, 1997Present: George Henne, Ryan Robertson, Marg Boots,  Garth Lewis1. Icon in extras drawer should have a double thick border.2. Icons need to be modified to look different if permission to use them can't be obtained.3. Info...Prefs should have an Export mode switch, and only show all the details in Expert mode.4. Info Slip: do the viewEffect to it when it is changed.5. In general, the slips should not have OK buttons. Use them only when not having one would lead to dire consequences. Even in the case of "New Stack", it doesn't matter much - just create Untitled Stack 1,2, 3...6. Info Slip, widgetSlip: the name field should automatically be selected when the slip is opened.7. Info Slip: Line up "When Arriving" under "Stack Name". Indent Play a sound, visual effect, and run a script a bit. Move "Mark this Card" up so it doesn't fall into the sacred button bar zone, even if it means making the slip taller.8. Info Slip, Action slip, etc: Get rid of ":" and "..." where ever they appear.9. "Run a Script" should always go back to the same slip when it returns from Editor.10. Under the NEW button, eliminate the word "New" on each of the choices.11. Overview button should put up a list of stacks.12. Widget Tool...New Button and New Field: The button should stay hilited and the popup should dodge the button.13. Widget Popup - fix line spacing. Icons probably all need to be made the same height if lineSpacing doesn't work.14. Widget Popup - the text descriptions should be stored as strings, not as converted symbols.15. Change name of "Tools" button to "Show"16. Background mode: Transform the bar with zig zags or diamonds17. Put the title of the stack in reverse video in the top right of the screen.18. Need keyboard shortcuts.19. Move "New Graphic" to the Draw Tool. Call it something like "import picture"20. Once the style of a button is set, it doesn't need to be changable. Let the user delete it and recreate it. On the other hand, perhaps change the title of the Widget Slip to echo the name of the widget: i.e., "Edit CheckBox"Big Issue #1The New button for Stack, Background and card. Both the New button and the Info button bring up the same slip. It's confusing that you can do the same thing more than one way, but info is really a different matter than New. We talking in circles about this one for a while, without reaching a clear resolution.Big Issue #2. New button, for New Button and New Field. Again, you can get at this stuff two ways. The feeling was to drop the option from the browser and just have it available from the Widget tool. (Perhaps a keyboard shortcut could still be provided for power users?)
